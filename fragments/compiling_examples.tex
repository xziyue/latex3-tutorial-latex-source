\subsection{Compiling Examples}

%This tutorial is based on examples.
To compile the examples in this tutorial, the minimum preamble required is:
\begin{latexsample}[examplelabel=ex:min-preamble,noexec]
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz} % load TikZ for some TikZ examples
\usepackage{expl3} % load latex3 packages
\end{latexsample}
\noindent The example code should be placed between \inltex|\begin{document}| and \inltex|\end{document}|. 
%\noindent The example code should be placed in the document body.
All examples have been tested with \TeX Live 2023.
For newer versions of \LaTeX{} compilers, there is no need to load the \verb|expl3| package explicitly (i.e., \lref{ex:min-preamble}{3} is optional).
